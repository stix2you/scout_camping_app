   <p>Last updated: [Date]</p>

   <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make

   <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
   <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information
      about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
      Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you
      view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the
      Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.</p>

   <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
         identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit

      <li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,

   </ul>

   <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
   <p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your
      IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how
      our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising
      campaigns).</p>

      can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>

   <p>Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to
      a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
